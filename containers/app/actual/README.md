## Accessing Actual

You should now be able to access http://localhost:5006 in your browser and you will see Actual.

When first accessing Actual, you may be prompted to provide a URL for the server. In this case (when installing locally), you can input http://localhost:5006 or click the “use this domain” button below the text field (which will do the same thing).
